        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Mise en place</strong></p>
                <p>Dice your vegetables ( peppers, onions, and tomatoes).
                    Mince your garlic and ginger. 
                    Peel and devein the shrimps as needed.
                    Heat up a pot </p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Action</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>
                    Fry up your onion and peppers with the oil, season with a bit of salt and pepper.
                    The salt will help get some moisture out. When they get translucent add the
                    garlic, ginger and a tsp of tomato paste. Fry up until fragrant, <strong>shouldnt take long</strong>.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                    Mix in your chopped tomatoes and let that fry too. Season with some more salt and pepper. <em>Not much, you can always add more later.</em>
                    Add the curry powder to taste and let that get some of the frying action too.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                    Once it is all fried, use a blender to turn the mixture into a gravy. If you want extra
                    silky texture, pass the gravy through a strainer.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                    Get your shrimps ready by browning them a bit. You can do that in the oven or a pan.
                    It doesn't matter if it's still raw, there will be time to cook it with the gravy.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                    Add the gravy back into the pot and add the vegetable stock and coconout milk.
                    Add the shrimps too.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>Now it is time for waiting. Let all that simmer for as long as you want.
                        Just be sure that whatever protein you are using gets cooked.
                        Taste it and add more salt or pepper as needed.
                    </p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Plating</strong></p>
                <p>This one is super simple, just add your curry to a dish bowl. Place some parsley leaves on it if you wish.
                    Use a laddle to serve on top of white rice or some naan.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
