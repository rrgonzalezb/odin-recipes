        <h2>Homemade Pasta Carbonara</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>400gr of egg pasta (preferably spaghetti)</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 pound guanciale (can be replaced by pancetta or bacon)</li>
            <li>1 cup of grated pecorino (can be mixed or replaced by parmesan)</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Mise en place</strong></p>
                <p>Cut the guanciale (pancetta or bacon) into chunks of your liking. 
                    Grate the cheese if you havent. Crack open your eggs and separate 
                    the yolks. Fill up a pot with water, salt it with your tbsp of salt and
                    put it in high heat.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Action</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>
                    As your water boils, add the chunks of guanciale intoa large frying pan.
                    The fat that renders from them should be enough to fry them up. When
                    the guancialeis gold and crispy take it out and reserve some of the fat that
                    rendered from it.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                    Mix your separated yolks with the grated cheese. You should get it
                    to the consistency of a paste (don't worry, it'll be cheesy!). Add some
                    pepper to it, as much as you like.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                    When the water boils, add your pasta. Cook it for as long as 
                    the package says. When the time is up, remove the pasta from the
                    water and add to a wide pot. <strong>Reserve a cup of the pasta water!</strong>
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                    Now, you should move quickly. Once in the pot, mix up the guanciale and 
                    some of its fat with the pasta. Don't take too long, for you must move quickly. 
                    Right away, with the pasta and guanciale still very hot, throw in the egg mixture and
                    mix vigorously. The egg will cook with the remaining heat and the sauce will come together
                    before your very own eyes. If it seems to you that it could be saucier or looser, throw in
                    some of the reserved pasta water. That should get it to the right consistency.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                    If you think the four egg yolks wont make enough sauce, you can add some of the 
                    egg whites. They lack the richness of the yolks, but will add quantity to the sauce.
                    </p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Plating</strong></p>
                <p>Nest your pasta on a plate, add some sauce on top. To make it look good,
                    fish out some chunks of guanciale and place them on top. Add a little of
                    balck pepper and grated cheese for a final touch.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
