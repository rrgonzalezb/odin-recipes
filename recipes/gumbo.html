        <h2>Chicken Gumbo</h2>
        <p>A New Orleans classic, this stew is perfect for a cold day or the morning after
            a night of partying. This dish takes a while (the more time you give it the better!) 
            but it is worth the wait.</p>
        <p>You can switch up the chicken for prawns if you like!</p>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Mise en place</strong></p>
                <p>Dice your vegetables (celery, peppers, and onion) and cut the chicken 
                    into chunks. Mince your garlic. Heat up a pot with a cup of vegetable oil
                    (go with medium to low heat).</p>
                <p>Get your chicken ready by browning it in a pan. It doesn't need to be fully coked.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Action</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>
                    Now it is time to make a roux! Don't worry, it is simple. <em>But it will
                    require your full attention</em>. Once your oil is heated up mix in a cup of flour
                    with a wisk. Mix constantly, it doesnt need to be hard or fast, just constant. Keep
                    it up until your mix (the roux) gets to a toasty, golde, brown color. Just like you can
                    see in the photo above.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                    When the roux is the proper color, mix in your diced onions, peppers and celery.
                    Keep whisking the whole thing together as the vegetables fry up. Don't forget
                    to season the roux with salt and pepper (better to go easy with them for now). When the vegetables
                    have begun to get translucent, throw in your minced garlic and cayenne pepper.
                    <strong>Be careful with the amount of cayenne you add.</strong>
                    Let the new ingredients fry up for a minute max, it should get fragrant!
                    </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>
                    With the roux and veggies ready, deglaze the pot with your dark beer. You don't need
                    to use all of it, just as much as you feel comfortable with. Let the alcohol cook off
                    and add the chicken stock, bay leaves, and chicken. <em>If you have them, add the sausages too.</em>
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                    Let it boil for a while, the longer the better! I reccoment, at least, an hour.
                    Get yourself a spoon and try it, if it needs more salt or pepper add it now.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p><em>This is not a white rice tutorial! You should have it done by now.</em></p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Plating</strong></p>
                <p>Preferably on a deep plate, serve up some white rice and your gumbo beside it.
                    Add some Parsley to give it a nice touch.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
